The goal of our community is to welcome everyone who is keen to participate in community tasks in commensuration of their time and efforts.
The welcome template can also be used for orgnaizations to invite their new members and hand hold them through the processes. 

* We plan to introduce one one one interactions when someone joins.
* Plan to add cards in a kanban board for a simplified welcoming process with each card directed toward activities in which The Good Docs Project is involved.
* Share a typeform link that asks about the person's likes before mapping them to an opportunity/template/group inside Good docs project.

Our primary goal is to make everyone feel welcomed who joins our community for a long-term role and also NOT get overwhlemed with the task list.
